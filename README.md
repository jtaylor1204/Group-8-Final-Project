## Overview

This app was created as a final project for my junior web developer bootcamp.

#### LIVE LINK : https://jtaylor1204.github.io/JWD-Final-Project/#

## Features

- You can add tasks to a task list with data including: task name, task description, task assignment (who will complete it), due date, and status (to-do, in review, in progress).

- Adding a task that is due today will populate the "today's tasks" and "all tasks" boxes.

- All other tasks will only populate the "all tasks" boxes.

- Tasks can be deleted from the screen and the task boxes.

## Bugs/Updates to be made - I am always open to comments and guidance on how to solve these!

- [ ] Fix the bug in the decrement of the task boxes (they currently only decrement to 1)
- [ ] The first day of the month prints as an extra day of the previous month (i.e; a task assigned a "11/1/2022" due date prints as "10/32/2022"
- [ ] Conduct more unit testing
- [ ] Add more React components
